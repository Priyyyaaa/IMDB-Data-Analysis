# IMDB-Data-Analysis

IMDB Movie Data contains information about the movies released in the past many years. This dataset contains information about the Movie right from the Directors to the Actors involved, Budget in which the film was made to the Gross it earned, movie's content rating, imdb score etc. 
<br>I plan to do an analysis on the same data to support the SussexBudgetProductions and to come up with a few suggestions to work on by keeping in mind the budget so that the company gets a great return with maximum profit.
